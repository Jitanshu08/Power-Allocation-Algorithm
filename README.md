# Power-Allocation-Algorithm
Power Allocation System (FIFO) A FIFO-based power allocation system that manages devices drawing power within a safe 92-unit limit. Devices connect, disconnect, or change consumption up to 40 units each. Power is dynamically allocated and redistributed based on connection order to ensure efficient and safe usage.
